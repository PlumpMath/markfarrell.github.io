Here is a personal list of questions that I have at the back of my mind, which I believe are open questions. These questions motivate some of the subject matter of my blog posts, at least in part.

- **Is it possible to construct a cubic walk-regular graph that is neither vertex-transitive nor distance-regular?**
- **What circulant graphs admit uniform mixing?**
