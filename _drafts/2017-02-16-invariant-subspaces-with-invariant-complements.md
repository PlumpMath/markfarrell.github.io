Suppose that $$V$$ is a finite-dimensional vector space over a field $$\mathbb{F}$$.

Then, in this context, I would propose that:

1. For all linear operators $$L : V \to V$$, if the minimal polynomial of $$L$$ is irreducible over $$\mathbb{F}$$ then every $$L$$-invariant subpace of $$V$$ has an $$L$$-invariant complement.

2. For all linear operators $$L : V \to V$$, if the minimal polynomial of $$L$$ splits into distinct linear factors over $$\mathbb{F}$$ then every $$L$$-invariant subpace of $$V$$ has an $$L$$-invariant complement.
