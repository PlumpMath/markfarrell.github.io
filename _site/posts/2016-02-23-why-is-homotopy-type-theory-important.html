<p>In response to: <a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-is-homotopy-type-theory-important">why is homotopy type theory important?</a></p>
<p>It is possible that homotopy type theory, as a research programme, could ultimately provide a formal system for doing homotopy theory <em>synthetically</em>; as in, roughly speaking, using <em>pure logic</em> to do homotopy theory <em>directly</em>, as opposed to taking an indirect analytic approach involving observational measurements and a coordinate system. To my understanding, the hope would be to use this synthetic approach to doing homotopy theory to solve generalized open problems in computing concrete representations of the homotopy groups of spheres; solving issues with computing concrete representations of the homotopy groups of spheres could, in turn, have implications for work in low-level physics and quantum computing, for example. As of now, my understanding is that there is mild-moderate progress being made with regards to using this synthetic approach to doing homotopy theory to achieve this goal. Mind you, there are currently still a lot of open problems with regards to foundational matters in homotopy type theory research, and this synthetic approach to doing homotopy theory isn’t really competing with the classical analytic approach, at the moment.</p>
<p>Although, I’ve just recently heard that a constructive, synthetic proof was given for the fact that <span class="math inline"><em>π</em><sub>4</sub>(<em>S</em><sup>3</sup>)=ℤ/2ℤ</span>. To my understanding, this means that, with the current state-of-the-art formal system for doing synthetic homotopy theory, it was possible to give a machine-verifiable proof that, for some natural number <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span>, <span class="math inline"><em>π</em><sub>4</sub>(<em>S</em><sup>3</sup>)=ℤ/<em>n</em>ℤ</span>, having <span class="math inline"><em>n</em> = 2</span> implicitly computed in the verification of the proof; mind you, the work of fully formalizing said recent proof in a machine-implementation of the state-of-the-art formal system for doing homotopy theory synthetically might still have to be done, since different people are simultaneously collaborating on the matter on different fronts. I’m under the impression that at some point, getting the foundational details worked out once-and-for-all in a formal system for doing homotopy theory synthetically, could lead to accelerated progress in using said formal system to solve generalized problems in computing concrete representations of the homotopy groups of spheres. With a proper formal system for doing homotopy theory synthetically, it could be possible to directly capture the descriptions of large classes of homotopy groups of spheres. If said foundational details were to worked out once-and-for-all, I believe the hope would be that this synthetic approach to doing homotopy theory would start to compete with the classical analytic approach at an accelerated rate, eventually surpassing progress on the analytic front.</p>
<p>With all of that being said, homotopy type theory arguably hasn’t been shown to be that important yet, at least when talking about it in the large, as a pragmatic tool, to people who might only take notice to it if was possible to use the synthetic approach to doing homotopy theory to outperform progress on the analytic front.</p>
