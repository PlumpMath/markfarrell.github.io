<p>In response to: <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-homotopy-type-theory/answer/Mark-Farrell-6">what is homotopy type theory?</a></p>
<p>I’d like to start by giving a motivational example in order to explain what homotopy type theory is about. I suppose in actuality there a few different perspectives you could take when approaching the subject of HoTT, but here is mine, currently: Suppose that you wanted to construct a machine-verifiable proof that the first homotopy group of the circle, i.e. its loop space, is the integers. More specifically, suppose that you wanted to find a path from the loop space of the circle to the integers. This would traditionally mean that you would want to prove that the loop space of the circle is propositionally equal to the integers. In a traditional type-theoretic setting, there were two rules about propositional equality that were thought to be admissible, stating that proofs of propositional equality are effectively unique, and that any two propositionally equal terms/types are also computationally equal. It might even sound quite intuitive that those rules be admissible because that’s how mathematics and computing is done broadly: i.e. given a proof that a = b, it is perfectly okay to substitute b for a and vice versa, when performing a computation via equational deductions. Coming from this perspective, however, there are some issues concerning those two rules for propositional equality that arise when trying to e.g. construct the circle as a data type and prove that its loop space is the integers.</p>
<p>Enter homotopy type theory. When trying to give a type-theoretic proof that the loop space of the circle is the integers, for example, it was noticed that perhaps something more interesting, and arguably fundamental, was going on with the notion of propositional equality between two terms/types. One of the original rules about propositional equality, stating that two propositionally equal terms/types are also computationally equal, was thought to be admissible, when considering Martin-Löf type theory as a foundation for mathematics and computing. However, in a particular mechanical formulation of Martin-Löf type theory known as formal intensional type theory, used in the core languages of modern computer proof checkers, this rule is not admitted; this is namely to keep proof checking procedures decidable. Mind you, at this point, the other thought-to-be-admissible rule, stating that proofs of propositional equality are effectively unique, is still admitted in the core languages of modern computer proof checkers, where formal intensional type theory makes an appearance. Long story short, a problem arises when trying to e.g. describe a logical circle as a data type in formal intensional type theory, in order to prove its loop space is the integers, as mentioned.</p>
<p>Now, a logical circle can be described by choosing a single base point on the circle, and constructing the space of paths from the chosen base point to itself. Traditionally, this would mean considering a single base point and the type of all proofs that the base point is propositionally equal to itself, when attempting to describe a logical circle type-theoretically. However, if proofs of propositional equality are to be considered unique in a formal system like formal intensional type theory, then it is not possible to describe a logical circle in said formal system; this is because the construction of a logical circle in such a formal system would collapse. More precisely, the logical circle would be a contractible type, meaning that given a pre-selected point on the circle, there is a path from the pre-selected point to any other point on the circle; again, more intuitively this would mean that the circle would collapse down to a single base point, and it wouldn’t be possible to work with its loop space in a computationally-relevant way. Furthermore, it would be counterintuitive coming from a topological perspective, if a logical circle were to be contractible; viewing types as spaces, the circle should not be a contractible space, and it would not be possible to e.g. prove that its loop space is the integers if this were the case.</p>
<p>Okay, so what is homotopy type theory at this point? To avoid potential confusion, I think our discussion requires a slight change on perspective. Ultimately, to construct a machine-verifiable proof that the loop space of the circle is the integers, we need a formal system with a general mechanism for constructing logical spaces (data types) that are generated not only by their points, but also by paths between their points, paths between their paths, etc. Homotopy type theory, as a research programme, aims to provide a formal system with support for constructing and utilizing said kinds of logical spaces; said kinds of logical spaces, generated by both points, paths, paths between paths, etc. are known as higher inductive data types. The circle is one example of a higher inductive data type. Also, to e.g. prove the loop space of the circle is the integers, we’re in need of something called a computational interpretation of the principle of univalence. In full generality, the principle of univalence says that any map from a path between two terms/types to a homotopy equivalence between two terms/types is itself a homotopy equivalence. For our proof that the loop space of the circle is the integers, we need a particular consequence of the principle of univalence, and we need to be able to compute with it: we need to be able construct a homotopy equivalence between the loop space of the circle and integers, and glue it into a path between the loop space of the circle and the integers, since it is not possible to construct such a path directly. In short, homotopy type theory seeks to extend/generalize formal type theory into a formal system with support for higher inductive data types and a computational interpretation of the principle of univalence - in effect having a computationally-relevant notion of paths between terms/types, in some respects richer and more general than the former global computationally-irrelevant notion of propositional equality between terms/types. At least, that might be one explanation for what homotopy type theory is, in a concrete sense.</p>
<p>Given support for higher inductive data types and a computational interpretation of univalence, we can now define the circle as a higher inductive data type, in order to prove that its loop space is the integers. The goal of this proof is to construct a homotopy equivalence between the circle and the integers, in this case meaning that we need to define two functions, one from the loop space of the circle to the integers and vice versa, and also provide (logical) homotopies containing computationally-relevant proofs that these two functions are mutual inverses. I won’t go into precise detail here of how to construct this proof, but I hope providing an outline will help motivate the importance and utilities of the features that the formal system from the homotopy type theory research programme would provide. To prove that the loop space of the circle is the integers, we’d first need to define what’s known as the logical helix. We’d define the logical helix by recursion on the structure of the circle as a higher inductive data type: we map the base point of the circle to the integers, and provide a path on the logical helix from the integers to the integers, showing that the circle’s loop space is also preserved when mapping it onto the helix. We’d then define a function that takes a selected point on the circle, a path from some point on the circle to the selected point on the circle, and produces a logical helix for that point on the circle; applying the base point on the circle to this function yields a function from the loop space of the circle to the integers. This first function would be defined by transporting the circle onto the helix with the two arguments provided, another core operation on paths supported by a formal system for homotopy type theory. Secondly, we’d define a function that given a selected point on the circle, and the helix at that selected point on the circle, produces a path on the circle from some point on that circle to that selected point. Applied to the base point on the circle, this second function would produce a function that takes an integer and gives a corresonding composition of loops in the loop space of the circle: e.g. -1 means looping around once counterclockwise on the circle, 0 means staying the base point, 1 means looping around once clockwise, and so on. Lastly, we’d need to define two logical homotopies providing proofs that our first two functions are mutual inverses at every point on the circle. I won’t go into the details of defining these two logical homotopies. However, if we were to define these two homotopies, we could ultimately glue our homotopy equivalence - built from our first two functions applied to the base point on the circle, as well as two homotopy-producing-functions applied to the base point on the circle - into a path between the loop space of the circle and integers. This would complete our proof, and show that the loop space of the circle is propositionally equal to the integers, in a setting where the notion propositional equality between terms/types has been succeeded by the more general notion of a path between terms/types.</p>
<p>I hope that I’ve helped shed some light on what homotopy type theory is about, via the motivating example of wanting to construct a machine-verifiable proof that the loop space of the circle is the integers. In short, homotopy type theory can perhaps be said to provide a formal system for / having support for doing homotopy theory synthetically (analogous to synthetic geometry), where proofs in said formal system are amenable to machine verification. However, the scope of homotopy type theory as a research programme is broader than what I’ve described. There may be unrealized potential in e.g. using homotopy type theory to solve open problems concerning finding concrete representations of the homotopy groups of spheres, for which generalized classes of solutions aren’t presently known. There is also work being done on using homotopy type theory to: describe and reason about the kinds of (infinite) structures found in (higher) category theory, formalize other work from algebraic topology in homotopy type theory, model physical phenomena in homotopy type theory from e.g. quantum field theory, and so on. I’m not very well-educated on any of these subdomains of knowledge, at the moment. However, I hope the explanations and example I have provided here so far about homotopy type theory will be nonetheless useful.</p>
